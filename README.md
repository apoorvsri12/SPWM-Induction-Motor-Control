# SPWM-Induction-Motor-Control
SPWM-Based Speed Control of 3-Phase Induction Motor using Inverter
**📌 Overview**

This project involves the simulation and control of a 3-phase induction motor drive using Sinusoidal Pulse Width

Modulation (SPWM) technique via a 3-phase inverter in MATLAB/Simulink.

It demonstrates how variable voltage and frequency output can be used to regulate the speed of an induction motor. 

The project helps in understanding the fundamental working of inverters, SPWM generation, and motor speed control.
